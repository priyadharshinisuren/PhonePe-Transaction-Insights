1. Decoding Transaction Dynamics on PhonePe
   1.State-Level Transaction
which states drive the highest transaction volumes and values
2.Quarterly Growth
this means measuring how transaction values change from one quarter to the next, either in absolute terms or as a percentage growth rate.
3.Top 10 Transactions
To get the Top 10 Transactions
4. highest revenue
5. lowest revenue
Recommendations:
Track total transactions over time (daily, monthly, yearly).
Compare growth across categories: money transfers, recharges, loans, insurance.
Monitor success rates, failure causes (network, insufficient balance, technical errors).
Track repeat usage and retention metrics
. Device Dominance and User Engagement Analysis
1.Registered Users by Device Brand
Registered Users by Device Brand from the PhonePe Pulse dataset
2. transaction percentage per year
3. Top 10 States per Year by Registered Users
4. Top 3 states overall total user
5. maximum registered users each year
3. Insurance Penetration and Growth Potential Analysis
   1.Quarterly Premiums by State
Group by State and Quarter, then sum the premium values.
2. Quarterly Premiums by State
group your dataset by State, Year, and Quarter, then sum the premium values
3. Insurance Product Segmentation by State and Year
4.High premiums in a particular year
5. Top 10 Performing States by Insurance Premium Amount
Recommendations:
Track the ratio of insurance users to total registered PhonePe users
Identify regions and demographics with high transaction activity but low insurance usage.
